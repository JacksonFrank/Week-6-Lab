## Why I choose this license and COC

MIT license, I think is the one of the most wide used license in GitHub. I think that MIT license give people enough right to change the program and also protects the original programmer's right. I choose to write this COC is because there are many common bias we are facing in every day of life. I chose the most common bias to write out in order to protect our community.
